<h1>Firewall Manager</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This Bash script is designed to manage firewall rules using either iptables or UFW, providing functionality to add or remove rules based on user input. The script first checks if it is run with root privileges. It then prompts the user to select between iptables and UFW for managing firewall rules, followed by a choice to either add or remove a rule. The user is then asked to provide the IP address, port, protocol (TCP/UDP), and action (allow/deny). Based on these inputs, the script executes the corresponding function to update the firewall rules accordingly, ensuring the system's network security configurations are appropriately managed.
